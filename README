== Project Overview

This is the first Rails e-commerce starter app.  Other e-commerce projects that
use rails, don't use rails in a standard way.  They use engines or are a separate 
framework altogether.  

Hadean is designed differently.  Hadean is simply a starter application written for 
Rails 3.  If you understand Rails you will understand Hadean.  There is nothing 
in this project that you wouldn't see in a normal Rails application.  If you don't like 
what is in the project just change it like you would in any other Rails app.  

Contributors are welcome.  For now email David Henner (drhenner@yahoo.com) to see how you 
can contribute. (send your patch if you have one.)  Soon there will be a bug tracking 
system and a formal way to submit your patch.  

We will always need help with UI, Documentation and code so feel free to help.
