== Project Overview

This is the first Rails e-commerce starter app.  Other e-commerce projects that
use rails, don't use rails in a standard way.  They use engines or are a separate 
framework altogether.  

Hadean is designed differently.  Hadean is simply a starter application written for 
Rails 3.  If you understand Rails you will understand Hadean.  There is nothing 
in this project that you wouldn't see in a normal Rails application.  If you don't like 
what is in the project just change it like you would in any other Rails app.  

Contributors are welcome.  For now email David Henner (drhenner@yahoo.com) to see how you 
can contribute. (send your patch if you have one.)  Soon there will be a bug tracking 
system and a formal way to submit your patch.  

We will always need help with UI, Documentation and code so feel free to help.

== Getting Started

Configure your database.yml file (add the development and test database)

1. Go into config/initializers/setting and change the encryption code
2. rake db:migrate
3. rake db:seed
4. rake db:test:prepare

5. git submodule init
6. git submodule update
7. gem install compass
8. gem install fancy-buttons

######compass install -r fancy-buttons -f fancy-buttons

# Time to start solr and memcache(yep you better install them)
rake sunspot:solr:start
## Take a look at setting up solr
## http://github.com/outoftime/sunspot/wiki/adding-sunspot-search-to-rails-in-5-minutes-or-less

memcached --vv  ## you can config many other cache stores but 
                ## the cookie store will not work (in the admin) and the DB session store will be a dog

Open config/config.yml and change the encryption key and paypal or auth.net information


Once everything is setup, start up the server and direct it to
admin/overviews

write down the username/password and follow the directions.


FYI:

Shipping categories are categories based off price:

you might have two shipping categories (light items) & (heavy items)
